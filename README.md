# Website-Osint-Workspace
This website is a practice project that will develop over time as I learn better techniques, acquire new methods, and gain other knowledge.

This website is a beginner's project, and it has been in development for 3 days (starting on July 31, 2024). It is open to changes from anyone who wants to help. The development will only involve code without using external applications. Additionally, this project is being developed using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), programming in Visual Studio Code, accessing the virtual machine, and utilizing the Linux system along with other programs to edit the code, compile it, and display it in real-time locally.
